test automation/continuous integration:
- setup buildbot farm

migrate:
- create 'wafimport' script that will;
-- use build scripts from make|cmake and convert it into wscripts
-- use project files from eclipse|msdev|codeblocks and convert it into wscripts

msdev:
- missing export of command line arguments
- programs using shared libraries can't be started/debugged (add to environment?)
	Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Environment; PATH=path/containing/shared/library

eclipse:
- add build in include paths when exporting .cproject using following command:
        echo | `gcc -print-prog-name=cc1` -v

externel deps:
- finish playground/pkg.py module; uses external packages using autoconf,make,cmake,...
