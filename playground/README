This directory contains an example of a C/C++ build environment using the ARM
cross compile toolchain from Linaro (http://www.linaro.org).
In order for this environment to work the path to arm gcc compiler must have been
added to the system path. 

Native build commands for the current host can be build in the usual way, build commands 
for the ARM platform can be started by adding the _arm postfix (e.g. ' waf build_arm' 
will start a build for the ARM target). See 'waf --help' for more information.
