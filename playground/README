Description
-----------
This directory contains an example of a C/C++ build environment using the ARM
cross compile toolchain from Linaro (http://www.linaro.org).
In order for this environment to work, the path to the arm cross compiler must have 
been added to your system path. 

Usage
-----
Native build commands for the current host can be issued in the usual way, build commands 
for the ARM platform can be started by adding the _arm postfix (e.g. ' waf build_arm' 
will start a build for the ARM target). See 'waf --help' for more information.
